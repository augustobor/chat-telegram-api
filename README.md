# chat-telegram-api

# 👋🏻 Hello! Welcome to my backend project "chat-telegram-api"

This API was built to have support on my project "chat-app". Models of user, chat and message are quite as similar as Telegram.

### Models

- *Chat*: The model contains chatID, users who participate in it by userID
- *User*: The model contains userID, profile photograph and name, 
- *Message*: The model contain messageID, message itself and ID's which identify its chat and the user who wrote it
